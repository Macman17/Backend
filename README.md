# Backend
We designed a clothing store that sales whole outfits instead of individual pieces of clothing. We allow our users to take a quiz and based off their answers provide them with clothing that matches their style. 

Working: backend endpoints and validations, sign-in screen, adding products and coupons, home screen, teen page

not working: buttons to go to each page from home screen, selecting a outfit, quiz incomplete.

Tech used:
Python
Flask
MongoDB
react
Vite
Bootstrap
Prime
Javascript
CSS
HTML
